## **Functional Modules**
Modules that use Functions to do stuff

### **Cave-Ins**

When mining there's a chance that the cave will collapse. Collapses can be smaller or bigger (like the one in the gif). You can stop collapses by using Logs.  
Ported from [TesseractFour](https://bitbucket.org/ChocoParrot/tesseractfour/src/master/).

### **Better Cauldrons**

With this module Cauldrons can do even more!
First off they can harden Concrete Powder instantly by consuming all the water.

![](/gifs/bc.concrete.gif)

They can also remove dye from more items such as Beds (consuming 1 water level) ...

![](/gifs/bc.bed.gif)

... Wool, Carpets and Terracotta (all the water required and consumed)

![](/gifs/bc.wool.gif)

They can also clean up Sticky Pistons and clean the Sticky part

### **Vacuum Hoppers**
Heavily inspired by [TesseractFour](https://bitbucket.org/ChocoParrot/tesseractfour/src/master/) Hoppers can now become Vacuum and pick up all the items in an area.  
To make a Basic Vacuum Hopper put those items in an Hopper and drop a Redstone Block in the Hopper.

![](https://i.imgur.com/bpeUCpg.png)

The Basic Vacuum Hopper will pick up one item per second in a 3x3x3 area.

Placing specific items in the Basic Vacuum Hopper it can be upgraded to an Advanced Vacuum Hopper.

![](https://i.imgur.com/t96XP45.png)

The Advanced Vacuum Hopper will pick up two items per second in a 7x7x7 area.

![](https://i.imgur.com/fYVMnFK.png)

The Super Vacuum Hopper can be created by putting the following items in an Advanced Vacuum Hopper

![](https://i.imgur.com/gn84YRi.png)

The Super Vacuum Hopper will pick up three items per second in a 11x11x11 area.

![](https://i.imgur.com/pCWq0aP.png)

Breaking a Vacuum Hopper will drop all the items used to craft it

### **Progressive Withers**
Ported from [TesseractFour](https://bitbucket.org/ChocoParrot/tesseractfour/src/master/) with some changes a module that makes the Wither Harder each time one is spawned.  
On spawn explosions will be stronger, Wither will have more health and will spawn Minions.  
**This Module also prevents the Wither from begin spawned inside Bedrock to get him stuck.**  
The difficulty increases for each player in a 60 block radius of the Wither. Also the difficulty of the Wither is the sum of the players' difficulty so more players = more difficulty.  
Health increases by 25 for each Wither Spawned (e.g. the 3rd wither spawned will have 375 health)

![](/gifs/progressive_withers.gif)

### **Depth Mobs**
Inspired by (Vazkii's mod) Quark's Depth Mobs feature and ported from [TesseractFour](https://bitbucket.org/ChocoParrot/tesseractfour/src/master/).  
New varieties of mobs will spawn underground, from Gas Creepers to Undead Miners.  

* Dweller  
Zombie Miner that has more health and full knockback resistance. Has twice the health of a normal Zombie

![](https://i.imgur.com/PpulpZ4.png)

* Zombie Summoner  
A simple Zombie variant that spawns more zombies nearby everytime you hit him. Has twice the health of a normal Zombie

![](https://i.imgur.com/0WK2nfA.png)

* Strex  
Skeleton Miner that drops lots of Coal on death

![](https://i.imgur.com/s0JDNVY.png)

* Repellent Skeleton  
Skeleton variant with a pretty Punchy Bow

![](https://i.imgur.com/CpZbkpC.png)

* Skeleton Depth Mage  
Skeleton Mage which "casts spells" when he hits you with his magical Stick

![](https://i.imgur.com/as7Crhs.png)

* Gas Creepers  
A wide variety of Gas Creepers exist which explode faster than a normal Creeper but will deal no damage on explosion and spawn a Gas Cloud with negative effects: Blindness, Immobilization (Strong Slowness), Weakness, Mining Fatigue, Hunger and Slowness

![](https://i.imgur.com/8B8yP2r.png)

* Hypercreeper  
A faster than normal creeper but much easier to kill

* Death Creeper  
A creeper that takes more time to explode than a normal Creeper but has a much powerful explosion

* Pig Jockey  
A Creeper Riding a Pig, as simple as that

### **Soul Forge**

Only the ancient livings of the Nether knew that power of Soul Fire can increase the yield from Ingot Ores.  
Build this 3 high structure (it's Fire in the center not a Soul Campfire):

![](https://i.imgur.com/8tknVQW.png?1)
![](https://i.imgur.com/sqpUst6.png?1)![](https://i.imgur.com/5iWvw2z.png?1)![](https://i.imgur.com/pEloL02.png?1)

Drop a Diamond in the Soul Fire, be careful, a lightning bolt might strike. You'll see bigger smoke particles (Campfire particles) coming from the fire

![](/gifs/soul_forge_craft.gif)

Now when smelting Iron and Gold ore in the Blast Furnace you'll get one more ingot in front of the Soul Forge

![](/gifs/soul_forge_work.gif)

Breaking any block of the structure will break the machine and drop the Diamond

### **Item Manipulator**

A book that lets you remove gravity from items, make them unable to despawn, be picked up and also center them to the block.

Demonstration video: 
[![Item Manipulator Demonstration video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/RpxdTXhd6Bw/mqdefault.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpxdTXhd6Bw "Item Manipulator Demonstration video")


### **Bedrock Breaker**

Let you break Bedrock by sacrificing a Netherite Pickaxe and some Redstone

Drop an undamaged Netherite Pickaxe in an Hopper filled with 2 Redstone Blocks, 1 Obsidian, 1 Comparator, 1 Obsidian and 2 Redstone Blocks

![](/gifs/bedrock_breaker_craft.gif)

After 10 minutes all the blocks (and Bedrock) in a 3 by 2 by 3 area will be destroyed

![](/gifs/bedrock_breaker_finish.gif)


### **XP Holder**

A chest to store your precious XP. Right-clicking on the XP Holder will tell you how much XP is contained.

Place the following items in the center of a chest and drop a diamond on top of it.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Evm1XZ4.png)

![](/gifs/xp_holder_craft.gif)

Stand on top of the chest to deposit XP and below to withdraw XP

![](/gifs/xp_holder_deposit.gif) ![](/gifs/xp_holder_withdraw.gif)

Destroying the chest will give back all the stored XP and every item used to craft it but the experience bottle

![](/gifs/xp_holder_destroy.gif)

And also a high chance to find a Trident (unenchanted, low enchanted or high enchanted)

Going to some plushies

And ending with higher level equipment, you can find things like Looting 4 and Protection 5. Those are highly damaged and require many levels to repair.

As for treasure chests there are slightly increased precious loot and two plushies

No more saddles and horse armors (I want them to be a rarer item so I left them only in some chests), but you'll find much more precious loot

![](https://i.imgur.com/gsu3YBU.png)

And also a chance to find two special items, the Slimeshield and the Speedy Bone that have bonus stats by giving up some other stats

Stronghold loot is ... useless, other than Ender Pearls. Stronghold corridors and crossings' chests have more precious loot and armor / tools are enchanted. You can find armor in Stronghold corridors and tools in crossings.

![](https://i.imgur.com/4L1NiSV.png) ![](https://i.imgur.com/Yns1J5m.png)

You can also find a "Dragon Slayer" in the Corridors, a sword with pretty high attack speed

* Pufferfish and Saddle Chance is lower.
* Enchanted books chance is slightly higher
* Junk now has a small chance to get Depth Strider enchanted Leather Boots

### Other Structures

Basically no changes, but if I get any idea on what to do with Woodland Mansions I will definitely change them since, they're pretty useless. "But they have totems!" ... sure, have you ever made a Raid? They made Mansions useless af  
Maybe I will make a Datapack for them with better items.


### **Blocks Tweaks**
* Stone has 10% chance to drop an Iron Nugget (increased by 1.25% per Fortune level, no Iron Nuggets with Silk Touch, explosions work)
* Basalt has 10% chance to drop a Gold Nugget (same as above)
* Cake will now drop itself if hasn't been yet eaten


### **How to Install**

Just drop the .zip in the `datapacks` folder of your world or drop them into the Data Packs screen on world creation.
