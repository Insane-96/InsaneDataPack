# **InsaneDataPack**

Welcome to InsaneDataPack, a modular set of datapacks that I like to play with. From Mob Heads to Better Loot Tables from Structures to *maybe* even some effective functionalities.

## **Functional Modules**
Modules that use Functions to do stuff

### **???**

???



## **"Passive" Modules** 
Modules that change e.g. Loot Tables but have no functions running

### **Recipe Tweaks**
* Crossbows can no longer be crafted, obtaining them requires Pillagers
* Redstone compontents now need Redstone
    * Levers, Pressure Plates and Buttons now all require redstone to be crafted, all can be made in 2x2 grid
* Beetroot soups can be made with only 3 beetroots instead of 6
* Dark prismarine is now crafted from Prismarine and not from Shards
* Clay balls can be made from Clay Block
* Minecarts with things in them can be directly crafted
* Sticks and Chests can be mass-crafted from logs
* Sticks can be obtained from saplings
* Dispensers can be crafted from droppers
* You can break down ladders to sticks

### **Better Structure Loot**

### Abandoned Mineshaft

In Abandoned Mineshafts you can now find many precious items, some food and tools left off the Miners, the items used by them to build the mineshaft and a few leftover enchanted books

### Buried Treasure

Buried Treasures have just some small changes: lowered precious loot amount and removed iron sword and leather chestplate.

But also a chance to find a Creeper Plushie

And also a high chance to find a Trident (unenchanted, low enchanted or high enchanted)
