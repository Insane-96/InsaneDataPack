# **InsaneDataPack**

Welcome to InsaneDataPack, a modular set of datapacks that I like to play with. From Mob Heads to Better Loot Tables from Structures to *maybe* even some effective functionalities.

## **Functional Modules**
Modules that use Functions to do stuff

### **???**

???



## **"Passive" Modules** 
Modules that change e.g. Loot Tables but have no functions running

### **Recipe Tweaks**
* Crossbows can no longer be crafted, obtaining them requires Pillagers
* Redstone compontents now need Redstone
    * Levers, Pressure Plates and Buttons now all require redstone to be crafted, all can be made in 2x2 grid
* Beetroot soups can be made with only 3 beetroots instead of 6
* Dark prismarine is now crafted from Prismarine and not from Shards
* Clay balls can be made from Clay Block
* Minecarts with things in them can be directly crafted
* Sticks and Chests can be mass-crafted from logs
* Sticks can be obtained from saplings
* Dispensers can be crafted from droppers
* You can break down ladders to sticks

### **Better Structure Loot**

### Abandoned Mineshaft

In Abandoned Mineshafts you can now find many precious items, some food and tools left off the Miners, the items used by them to build the mineshaft and a few leftover enchanted books

Also a Spoopy Alex Head

And as special item a Stone Eater with high Efficiency and huge Unbreaking

### Buried Treasure

Buried Treasures have just some small changes: lowered precious loot amount and removed iron sword and leather chestplate.

![](https://i.imgur.com/8TvFytr.png)

But also a chance to find a Creeper Plushie

![](https://i.imgur.com/ceuMuB2.png)

And also a high chance to find a Trident (unenchanted, low enchanted or high enchanted)

### Desert Pyramid

Desert Pyramids loot is now much more coherent with Deserts. The original loot hasn't changed much but you can now find Desert related items

![](https://i.imgur.com/F8LhWhc.png)

Also a special armor can be found here, the Cactus armor, a Green Dyed Leather Armor that has high Thorns and Durability

### End Cities

End Cities have the best loot of the game, starting with high level enchanted diamond and iron equipment

![](https://i.imgur.com/nfWNjyB.png)

Going to some plushies

![](https://i.imgur.com/lfu5jXe.png)

And ending with higher level equipment, you can find things like Looting 4 and Protection 5. Those are highly damaged and require many levels to repair.

### Igloo

Igloo chests have just one addition. An high chance to contain a Frost Walker book

### Jungle Temple

Jungle Temples have 100% more vines and precious stuff

![](https://i.imgur.com/zmjZXuo.png)

But also Parrot Plushies!

### Nether Fortress

Nether fortresses have slightly better loot, from potions to quartz

![](https://i.imgur.com/nJeMqJc.png)

To Wither Skeleton Skulls (pretty rare)

![](https://i.imgur.com/6yWM5NM.png)

### Shipwrecks

No more Leather Armor and Bamboo in the supply chest but high chance to find Flippers

![](https://i.imgur.com/MYDxoso.png)

As for treasure chests there are slightly increased precious loot and two plushies

![](https://i.imgur.com/ELepLIl.png)

### Dungeons

No more saddles and horse armors (I want them to be a rarer item so I left them only in some chests), but you'll find much more precious loot

![](https://i.imgur.com/gsu3YBU.png)

And also a chance to find two special items, the Defensive Slimeball and the Speedy Bone

![](https://i.imgur.com/Cfdfkc3.png) ![](https://i.imgur.com/6943XpD.png)

Also Spooky Steve head

![](https://i.imgur.com/UhIzDv4.png)

### Stronghold

Stronghold loot is ... useless, other than Ender Pearls. Stronghold corridors and crossings' chests have more precious loot and armor / tools are enchanted. You can find armor in Stronghold corridors and tools in crossings.

![](https://i.imgur.com/4L1NiSV.png) ![](https://i.imgur.com/Yns1J5m.png)

You can also find a "Dragon Slayer" in the Corridors, a sword with pretty high attack speed

![](https://i.imgur.com/M36Rsx3.png)

And a "I believe I can fly" in Crossings

![](https://i.imgur.com/5Hj9I3w.png)

Also not-so-rare chance to find a plush!

![](https://i.imgur.com/566EbIG.png)

In stronghold libraries instead loot has been redistributed better. You will always find at least one enchanted book.

![](https://i.imgur.com/d0QGdw9.png)

And also another plush!

![](https://i.imgur.com/5TcDd6w.png)

### Underwater Ruins

Added some crap stuff (seaweed and kelp)

![](https://i.imgur.com/MNGBqzE.png)

### Other Structures

Basically no changes, but if I get any idea on what to do with Woodland Mansions I will definitely change them since other than totems, they're pretty useless. Maybe I will make a Datapack with them.
