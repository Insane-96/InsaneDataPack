Welcome to InsaneDataPack, a modular set of datapacks that I like to play with. From some Recipes Tweaks to Better Structure Loot to some effective functionalities like Bedrock Breaker or XP Holder.

## **Functional Modules**
Modules that use Functions to do stuff

### **Depth Mobs**
Inspired by (Vazkii's mod) Quark's Depth Mobs feature and ported from TesseractFour (an old DataPack project by ChocoParrot).  
New varieties of mobs will spawn underground, from Gas Creepers to Undead Miners.  
Every mob that has a head has a small chance to drop it.

* Dweller  
Zombie Miner that has more health and full knockback resistance. Has twice the health of a normal Zombie

* Zombie Summoner  
A simple Zombie variant that spawns more zombies nearby everytime you hit him. Has twice the health of a normal Zombie

* Strex  
Skeleton Miner that drops lots of Coal on death

* Repellent Skeleton  
Skeleton variant with a pretty Punchy Bow

![](https://i.imgur.com/CpZbkpC.png)

* Skeleton Depth Mage  
Skeleton Mage which "casts spells" when he hits you with his magical Stick

![](https://i.imgur.com/as7Crhs.png)

* Gas Creepers  
A wide variety of Gas Creepers exist which explode faster than a normal Creeper but will deal no damage on explosion and spawn a Gas Cloud with negative effects: Blindness, Immobilization (Strong Slowness), Weakness, Mining Fatigue, Hunger and Slowness

![](https://i.imgur.com/8B8yP2r.png)

* Hypercreeper  
A faster than normal creeper but much easier to kill

* Death Creeper  
A creeper that takes more time to explode than a normal Creeper but has a much powerful explosion

### **Soul Forge**

Only the ancient livings of the Nether knew that power of Soul Fire can increase the yield from Ingot Ores.  
Build this 3 high structure (it's Fire in the center not a Soul Campfire):

Drop a Diamond in the Soul Fire, be careful, a lightning bolt might strike. You'll see bigger smoke particles (Campfire particles) coming from the fire

Now when smelting Iron and Gold ore in the Blast Furnace you'll get one more ingot in front of the Soul Forge

### **Item Manipulator**

A book that lets you remove gravity from items, make them unable to despawn, be picked up and also center them to the block.

Demonstration video: 
[![Item Manipulator Demonstration video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/RpxdTXhd6Bw/mqdefault.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpxdTXhd6Bw "Item Manipulator Demonstration video")


### **Bedrock Breaker**

Let you break Bedrock by sacrificing a Netherite Pickaxe and some Redstone

Drop an undamaged Netherite Pickaxe in an Hopper filled with 2 Redstone Blocks, 1 Obsidian, 1 Comparator, 1 Obsidian and 2 Redstone Blocks

![](/gifs/bedrock_breaker_craft.gif)

After 10 minutes all the blocks (and Bedrock) in a 3 by 2 by 3 area will be destroyed

![](/gifs/bedrock_breaker_finish.gif)


### **XP Holder**

A chest to store your precious XP

Place the following items in the center of a chest and drop a diamond on top of it

![](/gifs/xp_holder_craft.gif)

Stand on top of the chest to deposit XP and below to withdraw XP

![](/gifs/xp_holder_deposit.gif) ![](/gifs/xp_holder_withdraw.gif)

Destroying the chest will give back all the stored XP and every item used to craft it but the experience bottle

![](/gifs/xp_holder_destroy.gif)


### **Depth Mobs**

TODO


## **Passive Modules** 
Modules that change e.g. Loot Tables but have no functions running

### **Recipe Tweaks**
* Crossbows can no longer be crafted, obtaining them requires Pillagers / Piglins
* Redstone compontents now need Redstone
    * Levers, Pressure Plates and Buttons now all require redstone to be crafted, all can be made in 2x2 grid
* Beetroot soups can be made with only 3 beetroots instead of 6
* Sandstone and Red Sandstone recipe now outputs 2 instead of 1
* Dark prismarine is now crafted from Prismarine and not from Shards
* Clay balls can be made from Clay Block
* Minecarts with things in them can be directly crafted
* Sticks and Chests can be mass-crafted from logs
* Sticks can be obtained from saplings
* You can break down ladders to sticks

### **Better Structure Loot**

### Abandoned Mineshaft

In Abandoned Mineshafts you can now find many precious items, some food and tools left off the Miners, the items used by them to build the mineshaft and a few leftover enchanted books

![](https://i.imgur.com/TJtR875.png)![](https://i.imgur.com/NsuqyEZ.png)

Also a Spoopy Alex Head

![](https://i.imgur.com/6q8Amz6.png)

And as special item a Stone Eater with high Efficiency and huge Unbreaking

![](https://i.imgur.com/WQVGoiF.png)

### Buried Treasure

Buried Treasures have just some small changes: lowered precious loot amount and removed iron sword and leather chestplate.

![](https://i.imgur.com/8TvFytr.png)

But also a chance to find a Creeper Plushie

![](https://i.imgur.com/ceuMuB2.png)

And also a high chance to find a Trident (unenchanted, low enchanted or high enchanted)

![](https://i.imgur.com/jcUMC2P.png)

### Desert Pyramid

Desert Pyramids loot is now much more coherent with Deserts. The original loot hasn't changed much but you can now find Desert related items

![](https://i.imgur.com/F8LhWhc.png)

Also a special armor can be found here, the Cactus armor, a Green Dyed Leather Armor that has high Thorns and Durability

![](https://i.imgur.com/ENyhFKF.png)

### End Cities

End Cities have the best loot of the game, starting with high level enchanted diamond and iron equipment

![](https://i.imgur.com/nfWNjyB.png)

Going to some plushies

![](https://i.imgur.com/lfu5jXe.png)

And ending with higher level equipment, you can find things like Looting 4 and Protection 5. Those are highly damaged and require many levels to repair.

![](https://i.imgur.com/dn2qnyS.png) ![](https://i.imgur.com/rQriKCg.png) ![](https://i.imgur.com/aRq6x7i.png)

### Igloo

Igloo chests have just one addition. An high chance to contain a Frost Walker book

### Jungle Temple

Jungle Temples have 100% more vines and precious stuff

![](https://i.imgur.com/zmjZXuo.png)

But also Parrot Plushies!

![](https://i.imgur.com/fSH0UYm.png)

### Nether Fortress

Nether fortresses have slightly better loot, from potions to quartz

![](https://i.imgur.com/nJeMqJc.png)

To Wither Skeleton Skulls (pretty rare)

![](https://i.imgur.com/6yWM5NM.png)

### Shipwrecks

No more Leather Armor and Bamboo in the supply chest but high chance to find Flippers

![](https://i.imgur.com/MYDxoso.png)

As for treasure chests there are slightly increased precious loot and two plushies

![](https://i.imgur.com/ELepLIl.png)

### Dungeons

No more saddles and horse armors (I want them to be a rarer item so I left them only in some chests), but you'll find much more precious loot

![](https://i.imgur.com/gsu3YBU.png)

And also a chance to find two special items, the Defensive Slimeball and the Speedy Bone

![](https://i.imgur.com/Cfdfkc3.png) ![](https://i.imgur.com/6943XpD.png)

Also Spooky Steve head

![](https://i.imgur.com/UhIzDv4.png)

### Stronghold

Stronghold loot is ... useless, other than Ender Pearls. Stronghold corridors and crossings' chests have more precious loot and armor / tools are enchanted. You can find armor in Stronghold corridors and tools in crossings.

![](https://i.imgur.com/4L1NiSV.png) ![](https://i.imgur.com/Yns1J5m.png)

You can also find a "Dragon Slayer" in the Corridors, a sword with pretty high attack speed

![](https://i.imgur.com/M36Rsx3.png)

And a "I believe I can fly" in Crossings

![](https://i.imgur.com/5Hj9I3w.png)

Also not-so-rare chance to find a plush!

![](https://i.imgur.com/566EbIG.png)

In stronghold libraries instead loot has been redistributed better. You will always find at least one enchanted book.

![](https://i.imgur.com/d0QGdw9.png)

And also another plush!

![](https://i.imgur.com/5TcDd6w.png)

### Underwater Ruins

Added some crap stuff (seaweed and kelp)

![](https://i.imgur.com/MNGBqzE.png)

### Villages

Villages house chests can have two plushes: Villager and Goat

![](https://i.imgur.com/5BsjPv5.png)

### Other Structures

Basically no changes, but if I get any idea on what to do with Woodland Mansions I will definitely change them since other than totems, they're pretty useless. Maybe I will make a Datapack with them.

### **How to Install**

Just drop the .zip in the `datapacks` folder of your world or drop them into the Data Packs screen on world creation.
